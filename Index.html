        <p>
            I am a senior software developer with over six years of hands-on experience
            in designing and delivering enterprise-grade applications. My primary focus
            has been on backend development using the .NET ecosystem, where performance,
            stability, and clean architecture are critical.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked on products that evolved from early-stage platforms to
            large-scale systems, including solutions that were successfully
            <strong>acquired by industry leaders</strong>.

                GeoData was a data-intensive platform focused on processing and
                managing large-scale geographic and property-related datasets.
                I worked on backend services, API development, and database optimization
                to ensure high performance and reliability.

                The product was later <strong>acquired by ATTOM Data Solutions</strong>,

            <p>
                MyCubo is an enterprise software platform designed to support fleet and
                mobility management use cases by providing centralized visibility into
                vehicle-related operations and mobility data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform focuses on operational monitoring, utilization tracking,
                and data-driven decision-making, while maintaining scalability and
                seamless integration with other enterprise systems.

        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">Engineering Approach</h2>
        <p>
            I prioritize clarity over complexity, scalability over shortcuts,
            and maintainability over quick fixes. I enjoy working on systems
            where thoughtful design decisions make a long-term impact and
            mentoring team members to raise overall code quality.
